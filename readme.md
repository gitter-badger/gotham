## 1.	<b>Overview</b>
a.	<b>Gotham</b> is a web based Request for Information (RFI) management tool that will allow users to create, review, update, and display RFI’s.

## 2.        <b>Task Checklist</b> 
The following checklist is based on the low-level tasks that I have identified during my planning phase of this project. Following this checklist will allow us to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The higher-level tasks will be turned into issues with there own corresponding checklists and milestones. 

1. Write out the overview of what the tool/App/Software does
2. Determine all required tasks needed to produce a MVP based on High/Mid/Low level task (i.e. High-level –- Create a Plan for developing this tool/App/Software, Mid-level –- Complete development Plan, Low-level – Create a task checklist)
3. Create a timeline to complete all required tasks
4. Create a task checklist
5. Determine what web app framework/tools and languages we want to use 
6. Determine where we want to host main development repository
7. Build a shell for the project
8. Conduct an initial commit to repository
9. Determine what the template page of the tool will look like
10. Color Scheme
11. Display layout for Header, menu, content, footer
12. Code template page for all pages
13. Determine what the login page will look like
14. Determine what the registration page will look like
15. Code login page
16. Code registration page
17. Determine what user level permissions are required (i.e. Admin, Standard User, Super User)
18. Determine what the user table in the Database (DB) will look like
19. Build the “User” Database table
20. Determine what the “Add-RFI” page will look like
21. Determine what the “Display-RFI” page will look like
22. Determine what the “Edit-RFI” page will look like
23. Determine what the “Delete-RFI” page will look like (This may possibly just be a redirect after performing the delete action
24. Code the “Add-RFI” page
25. Code the “Display-RFI” page
26. Code the “Edit-RFI” page
27. Code the “Delete-RFI” page
28. Determine what the RFI table will look like in the DB
29. Build the “RFI” database table
30. Determine what the Dashboard page will look like
31. Code “Dashboard” page
32. Determine what the user management portal will look like
33. Determine what the add user page will look like
34. Determine what the display user page will look like
35. Determine what the edit user page will look like
36. Determine what the delete user page will look like
37. Code the “Add-user” page
38. Code the “Display-user” page
39. Code the “Edit-user” page
40. Code the “Delete-user” page

##3.        <b>Timeline</b>
